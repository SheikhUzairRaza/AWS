# AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

## What is EC2?

- **EC2** stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud**.
- EC2 is an **AWS service that provides virtual servers (virtual machines)** in the cloud.
- These virtual machines are used just like physical servers.

---

## Comparison with Other Platforms

| Platform        | Name Used            |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| On-Premises     | Physical Server      |
| Microsoft Azure | Virtual Machine (VM) |
| AWS             | EC2 Instance         |

> **EC2 and Virtual Machine mean the same thing**, only the naming differs.

---

## What Does “Compute” Mean?

- A **compute resource** is a machine capable of:
  - Executing code
  - Processing data
  - Producing output

### Examples

- Running programs written in C, Java, Python
- Performing calculations (2 + 2 = 4)
- Hosting applications and websites

➡️ **EC2 is a computing resource in the cloud**

---

## Real-World Example (On-Prem vs Cloud)

### On-Premises Server

- Physical hardware (e.g., Dell server)
- OS installed manually (e.g., Windows Server 2012)
- Used for:
  - Active Directory
  - Web Server
  - Application Hosting

### Cloud (AWS EC2)

- Same tasks are performed on **virtual machines**
- No physical hardware management
- Infrastructure is managed by AWS

---

## Key Features of Amazon EC2

### 1. Scalable Computing Capacity

- Resources can be **scaled as per requirement**
- Examples:
  - 4 GB RAM → 8 GB → 16 GB
  - Increase CPU power
  - Increase storage size

➡️ No need to buy a new server when the business grows

---

### 2. Flexible Storage Options

- You can attach:
  - Root volume (e.g., 500 GB)
  - Additional external volumes (e.g., 5 TB)
- Storage can be expanded anytime

---

### 3. Pay-as-You-Go Model

- Pay only for what you use
- No upfront hardware cost

---

### 4. Launch Any Number of Instances

- Multiple EC2 instances can be created in one AWS account
- Default limits apply, but:
  - Limits can be increased by requesting AWS

---

### 5. Important Terminology

| Term         | Meaning         |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| EC2 Instance | Virtual Machine |
| Instance     | Virtual Server  |
| Server       | EC2 / VM        |

➡️ In AWS, **“Instance” = Virtual Machine**

---

### 6. Security and Networking Control

- You can configure:
  - Security rules
  - Networking
  - Access permissions
- Full control over server communication

# AWS EC2 – Scaling, Billing, Storage & AMI Notes

---

## Scalable Resources in AWS EC2

- EC2 provides **scalable computing resources**.
- You can **launch as many or as few virtual servers as needed**.
- In AWS:
  - Virtual Server
  - Virtual Machine
  - Instance
    **→ All mean the same thing**
- AWS commonly uses the term **Instance**.
- **EC2 Instance = Virtual Machine**

---

## EC2 Capabilities

Using EC2, you can:

- Launch virtual servers as required
- Configure:
  - **Security**
  - **Networking**
  - **Storage**
- Perform everything that is possible on a **physical server**, but in the cloud.

---

## Instance Limits

- You can create multiple EC2 instances under one AWS account.
- There is a **default limit**, but:
  - Limits can be **extended by requesting AWS**
- Practically, you can run **many servers** based on your needs.

---

## Scaling in EC2 (Scale Up & Scale Down)

### Scale Up (Vertical Scaling)

- Increase the capacity of an existing instance:
  - More RAM
  - More CPU
  - More storage
- No need to create a new server.

### Scale Down

- Reduce instance size when workload decreases.
- Helps **save cost**.

---

## Real-Life Analogy (Utensil Example)

- Small utensil = small server
- Guests arrive = increased workload
- Instead of buying a new utensil (server):
  - You temporarily use a bigger one
- Buying a bigger utensil permanently causes **under-utilization**
- Cloud solves this by allowing **temporary scaling**

➡️ EC2 lets you **resize the same server**, not replace it.

---

## Cost Efficiency (Pay-as-You-Go Model)

- EC2 billing is **usage-based**:
  - Pay only for the time the instance is running
- Examples:
  - 1 hour usage → Pay for 1 hour
  - 8 hours usage → Pay for 8 hours
- If you use a server **9 AM – 5 PM**:
  - You pay only for **8 hours**
  - Not for the full 24 hours

---

## Per-Second Billing

- Especially for **Linux instances**:
  - Billing can be **per second**
- Example:
  - Used for 2 hours 10 minutes
  - You are billed only for **2 hours 10 minutes**
- Introduced due to competition:
  - Microsoft Azure
  - Google Cloud

---

## Key Billing Advantage

- No charge when the instance is **stopped**
- You can:
  - Start when needed
  - Stop when not needed
- Billing applies **only during usage**

---

## EC2 Storage Options

Amazon EC2 supports **two storage types**:

### 1. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

- Separate from the physical host
- **Persistent storage**
- Data remains even after instance stops

### 2. Instance Store

- Storage comes from the **host machine**
- **Very fast**
- **Non-persistent**
- Data is deleted when the instance stops or terminates

---

## Root Volume

- Root volume is where the **Operating System is installed**
- Root volume can use:
  - EBS
  - Instance Store

---

## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

- AMI = **Pre-configured template**
- Contains:
  - Operating System
  - Software
  - Basic configurations

### Benefits of AMI

- No need to install everything manually
- Server is ready in **2–3 minutes**.

# AWS EC2 – AMI Templates, Limits & Instance Types

## Amazon Machine Images (AMI) – Continued

- Once you select an AMI and launch the instance:
  - The server is ready within **2–3 minutes**
- Multiple AMI templates are available, such as:
  - Windows Server 2012
  - Linux servers
  - Ubuntu
  - Red Hat Linux
  - Apache Web Server
- Templates are available for **almost every configuration and use case**
- You simply:
  - Select the template
  - Launch the instance
  - Connect using:
    - **RDP** (for Windows)
    - **SSH** (for Linux)

---

## AWS Marketplace AMIs

- If you need AMIs for **specific applications**, you can use:
  - SQL Server
  - VPN servers (OpenVPN, etc.)
  - Other enterprise applications
- These AMIs are available on the **Amazon Marketplace**
- Most **hands-on labs** are done using AMI templates

---

## EC2 Instance Limits

### Default EC2 Limits

- By default, an AWS account can create:
  - **20 EC2 instances per region**
- This is one of the **most frequently asked interview and exam questions**

### Region-wise Limits

- Limits are applied **per region**, not per account globally
- Example:
  - Mumbai region → 20 instances
  - US region → 20 instances
  - UK region → 20 instances
- Each region has its **own independent limit**

### Increasing the Limit

- If more than 20 instances are required in a region:
  - You must raise a request to AWS
  - AWS can **extend the limit**

---

## AWS Regions Explained

- Regions are geographic locations such as:
  - Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
  - US Regions
  - Singapore
  - UK
- You can create up to **20 EC2 instances in each region by default**
